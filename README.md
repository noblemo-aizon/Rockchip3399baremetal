Orange Pi 4 (Rockchip RK3399)

These are my bare metal programming projects for the RK3399 on the Orange Pi 4.

Most of my notes are on my website:

http://cholla.mmto.org/orange_pi/rockchip/

Here are the projects you will find here:

* hello - a simple "do something" first project.
* blink - use the GPIO to blink the on-boardLED.
* printf - add printf to the blink demo (and more)
* inter - generate an interrupt
* make_boot - put U-Boot onto TF card
* mkrock - make a bootable idbloader file
* bare_blink - blink demo loaded directly by bootrom
